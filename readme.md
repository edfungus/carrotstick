# Carrot Stick

Still a work in progress!

Imagine an ice cooler ... but with wheels ... and it follows you ... while you bike to your pinic. :)


### Tasks

* get arcore working
* detect some object and track it (I chose something in the shade of red/orange/pink)
* create an ar anchor onto the object being tracked
* test connection to motors (bluetooth?)
* create some drive mechanism 
* ... profit!?
